## About
Hi, my name is Gabriel Lima and I have a degree in computer engineering from IFPB-CG, I'm currently working at Capyba Software Studio.<br/>Since 2019 I've been working in the professional programming market, as a Fullstack engineer in most of my experiences, but my main area of expertise is the backend.<br/>I love studying new things, mainly related to microservices, architectures or good programming practices, SOLID and Clean Code concepts, these are subjects that I am always discussing with my teammates so that we can bring ever better environments to our development.<br/>Besides software development, I am also passionate about games and music. If you're looking for someone to swap stickers with on these topics, feel free to send me a request. I love sharing knowledge and learning from others.
